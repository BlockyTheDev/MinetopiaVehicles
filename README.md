## How to download?

The plugin works on all spigot versions from 1.12.2 - 1.18.1, **except 1.14.x**!

### Be aware!


If your server minecraft version is not supported by the plugin, it won't load.

Versions 1.12.1 and lower are not, and will not be supported.<br>
(Did you know that 1.8 was released in 2014? And some people still use it! Whoa.)


> ⚠ We support ALL LATEST PATCH VERSIONS of Spigot/Paper 1.12+, except 1.14.4.<br>
> For example 1.16.5 IS supported, but 1.16.3 is not (and similarly with all other versions).

### 1. Download the latest version
- Latest stable releases are always published on <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/80910/">Spigot.org</a>.

Put the downloaded plugin into your server's `plugins/` folder.

### 2. Download the resource pack
- **Download the resource pack.** Link can be found on our <a href="https://discord.gg/vehicle">Discord server</a> (We've created a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSXNd-6rhQk">YouTube tutorial</a>).

You may set it as a server resource pack, or everyone would have to download the resource pack individually. (For instance, take a look <a href="https://apexminecrafthosting.com/how-to-upload-a-resource-pack/" taget="_blank">here</a>.)

> ⚠ The vehicles WON'T look properly without the resource pack.

### 3. Restart the server
Restart the server. No explanation needed right?

### 4. Enjoy!
**Et voilà, it's working!** Don't forget to set your language using `/vehicle language`.<br>

If this did not work don't hesitate to contact the support on our Discord server.

## **Softdependencies**

### WorldGuard

You can download <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard">WorldGuard</a> to get access to custom features with regions. (Do not forget that WorldGuard needs WorldEdit as its dependency.)

> ⚠ WorldGuard features are not supported on 1.12.2 as it is no longer maintained and uses older API version.

You can edit the behaviour **in the config** where you may also find information how to set up the custom flags.

> ⚠ WorldGuard features are disabled by default and have to be enabled in the config.

| Custom flags     | State | Description                                                                                    |
